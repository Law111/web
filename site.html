 <h2>The Beginning</h2>
  <p>This is an intro to Minecraft Parkour. If you've ever played Minecraft, you've most likely have done some sort of parkour before, if it's just jumping around blocks, running around your survival world while dodging dangers, or doing parkour courses from servers. However, there is much more to parkour than what the average person knows about.</p>
  <p>If you haven't played Minecraft before, here are the things that control your character's movement. WASD is forward, left, down, and right, respectively. SHIFT allows you to sneak, like if you're on the edge of a block while sneaking, you won't be able to walk off. L CTRL is the most used sprint key, allowing the player to sprint, or run faster as compared to walking. Space allows you to jump. Now, the mouse is crucial for the movement of your character. The movement of your mouse determines the direction your character faces. This is the case in most fps shooters and such.</p>
