 <h2>The Beginning</h2>
  <p>This is an intro to Minecraft Parkour. If you've ever played Minecraft, you've most likely have done some sort of parkour before, if it's just jumping around blocks, running around your survival world while dodging dangers, or doing parkour courses from servers. However, there is much more to parkour than what the average person knows about.
  <br>Firstly, Minecraft is a game that was released on November 2011, and is one of the best-selling games of all time. There are hundreds of millions of people playing Minecraft every month. In Minecraft, there are these communities that are created, such as the speedrunning community, pvp community, parkour community, etc. The Parkour Community is a relatively small community consisting of only a few thousand players. This site will be a brief introduction to the world of parkour, hopefully getting people interested in trying parkour.</p>
