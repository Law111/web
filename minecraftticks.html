<h2>Mineraft Ticks</h2>
  <p>Minecraft is run by ticks. In fact, a huge number of games are driven by a similar system. In Minecraft, there are normally 20 ticks per second, meaning each tick happens every .05 sec or 50ms. Every tick, calculations are run to manage the game, may it be the character movement, entity movements, blocks breaking, and so forth. Parkour is widely based off of ticks. Every key that is pressed is based off of ticks. If you press the w key and hold it for about 50ms, then let go, you will have moved forward for 1 tick. However, since the game is based off of ticks, movement is calculated only after a full 50ms. To make sense of this, if you press w at, let's say 10ms of the start of a tick, then let go after, let's say another 10ms, you will not have moved. That is because the game recognizes that you have not held down any key at the end of the tick. You held it down from 10-20ms, and at 50ms, you would not have been holding w. This is all that is really needed to know about when it comes to what ticks are in parkour.
