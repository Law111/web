<p>This is an intro to Minecraft Parkour. If you've ever played Minecraft, you've most likely have done some sort of parkour before, if it's just jumping around blocks, running around your survival world while dodging dangers, or doing parkour courses from servers. However, there is much more to parkour than what the average person knows about.</p>
<p>If you haven't played Minecraft before, here are the things that control your character's movement. WASD is forward, left, down, and right, respectively. SHIFT allows you to sneak, like if you're on the edge of a block while sneaking, you won't be able to walk off. L CTRL is the most used sprint key, allowing the player to sprint, or run faster as compared to walking. Space allows you to jump. Now, the mouse is crucial for the movement of your character. The movement of your mouse determines the direction your character faces. This is the case in most fps shooters and such.</p>
<p>Minecraft is run by ticks. In fact, a huge number of games are driven by a similar system. In Minecraft, there are normally 20 ticks per second, meaning each tick happens every .05 sec or 50ms. Every tick, calculations are run to manage the game, may it be the character movement, entity movements, blocks breaking, and so forth. Parkour is widely based off of ticks. Every key that is pressed is based off of ticks. If you press the w key and hold it for about 50ms, then let go, you will have moved forward for 1 tick. However, since the game is based off of ticks, movement is calculated only after a full 50ms. To make sense of this, if you press w at, let's say 10ms of the start of a tick, then let go after, let's say another 10ms, you will not have moved. That is because the game recognizes that you have not held down any key at the end of the tick. You held it down from 10-20ms, and at 50ms, you would not have been holding w. This is all that is really needed to know about when it comes to what ticks are in parkour.</p>
<p>Minecraft parkour has a large variety of strategies and techniques that have been created over the years, as well as lots of confusing terminology. Let's start with terminology. BC stands for block ceiling. If there is a block above your head, then the distance from the block you are standing on and the block above will be the number BC that it is. For example, a block 3 blocks above your head is considered 3bc. 2 blocks is 2bc. An important thing to note is that in version 1.8, the player jump height is about 1.249, meaning anything above 1.25bc is rather redundant. However, in 1.9 and higher, the jump height is about 1.252. This shows the differences between versions, but otherwise shouldn't be too impactful if you mainly play a certain version. BM stands for blocks of momentum, of the number of blocks you have before the jump. Let's take a random jump, like 3bm 4+0.5. The jump has 3 blocks of momentum to complete the jump. The plus sign shown in that jump is actually elevation, meaning that it's a 4 block jump + 0.5 blocks upward. MM stands for momentum, but it's a different meaning. This is a term for a specific type of momentum used for specific jumps, for example, cyn bwmm, rex bwmm, loop mm, hh mm, burst mm, fmm, etc. These specific strategies have been created over the years to help make jumps easier and push the limits of parkour.</p>
<p>With the explanation of terminology, here are a few strategies that are good to know about: A jam: holding the sprint key, then pressing w and space at the same time, to allow you to jump and move forward at the same time. A headhitter: pressing w for 1 tick, then pressing jump 1 tick after. In a case that there is a 2bc jump, if you recall, a block 2 blocks above your head, it requires you to run out of the block, THEN jump, in which case your player will be able to jump out of the 2bc, instead of hitting your head. a7mm/jump jam: jump once in place, then once you land, re-press the jump key and also press the w key as well. It is an alternative to jamming, and is used in specific scenarios that isn't too important to know about. Fmm: This is the same as jamming, HOWEVER, you don't hold sprint until after you jump. For example, 2t fmm, t being tick, is when you jam, then press sprint 2 ticks later. Max fmm is when you press sprint only 1t later, and it is literally the maximum fmm that can be performed. The purpose of fmming is when you have, for example, 1bm, or 1 block of momentum. An optimal strategy to go as far as possible on that 1bm is to go to the edge of the block, then perform fmm. This gives you 1 prejump of momentum, then another to complete the jump. But, 1bm has been further optimized. Let's look at c4.5. This get's a bit complicated, so bear with me. c4.5 stands for carpet 4.5, and it is done in a 1bm 4 block jump + 0.5, however the block you are standing on has a carpet. This jump may seem impossible, which it pretty much is, unless you do this strategy. First, you jam w and space. Next, press sprint 4t later. Next, before you land on the block, let go of space. Next, run on the block for 1 tick. Lastly, jump after you've ran for 1 tick. To a beginner, this looks rather ridiculous to even understand, but through muscle memory and lots of practice, these strategies will actually become a piece of cake.</p>
<p>These are the basics to parkour. Hopefully, this has opened up your mind or even interested you into playing parkour. Parkour is very fun, and once you are good at it, it gets even better. There is still a whole other world to parkour that is yet to be explored.</p>
