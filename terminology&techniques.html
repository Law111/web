 <h2>Parkour Terminology and Techniques</h2>
  <p>Minecraft parkour has a large variety of strategies and techniques that have been created over the years, as well as lots of confusing terminology. Let's start with terminology. BC stands for block ceiling. If there is a block above your head, then the distance from the block you are standing on and the block above will be the number BC that it is. For example, a block 3 blocks above your head is considered 3bc. 2 blocks is 2bc. An important thing to note is that in version 1.8, the player jump height is about 1.249, meaning anything above 1.25bc is rather redundant. However, in 1.9 and higher, the jump height is about 1.252. This shows the differences between versions, but otherwise shouldn't be too impactful if you mainly play a certain version. BM stands for blocks of momentum, of the number of blocks you have before the jump. Let's take a random jump, like 3bm 4+0.5. The jump has 3 blocks of momentum to complete the jump. The plus sign shown in that jump is actually elevation, meaning that it's a 4 block jump + 0.5 blocks upward. MM stands for momentum, but it's a different meaning. This is a term for a specific type of momentum used for specific jumps, for example, cyn bwmm, rex bwmm, loop mm, hh mm, burst mm, fmm, etc. These specific strategies have been created over the years to help make jumps easier and push the limits of parkour.</p>
  <p>With the explanation of terminology, here are a few strategies that are good to know about: A jam: holding the sprint key, then pressing w and space at the same time, to allow you to jump and move forward at the same time. A headhitter: pressing w for 1 tick, then pressing jump 1 tick after. In a case that there is a 2bc jump, if you recall, a block 2 blocks above your head, it requires you to run out of the block, THEN jump, in which case your player will be able to jump out of the 2bc, instead of hitting your head. a7mm/jump jam: jump once in place, then once you land, re-press the jump key and also press the w key as well. It is an alternative to jamming, and is used in specific scenarios that isn't too important to know about. Fmm: This is the same as jamming, HOWEVER, you don't hold sprint until after you jump. For example, 2t fmm, t being tick, is when you jam, then press sprint 2 ticks later. Max fmm is when you press sprint only 1t later, and it is literally the maximum fmm that can be performed. The purpose of fmming is when you have, for example, 1bm, or 1 block of momentum. An optimal strategy to go as far as possible on that 1bm is to go to the edge of the block, then perform fmm. This gives you 1 prejump of momentum, then another to complete the jump. But, 1bm has been further optimized. Let's look at c4.5. This get's a bit complicated, so bear with me. c4.5 stands for carpet 4.5, and it is done in a 1bm 4 block jump + 0.5, however the block you are standing on has a carpet. This jump may seem impossible, which it pretty much is, unless you do this strategy. First, you jam w and space. Next, press sprint 4t later. Next, before you land on the block, let go of space. Next, run on the block for 1 tick. Lastly, jump after you've ran for 1 tick. To a beginner, this looks rather ridiculous to even understand, but through muscle memory and lots of practice, these strategies will actually become a piece of cake.</p>
