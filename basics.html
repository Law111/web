<h2>The Basics</h2>
<p>If you haven't played Minecraft before, here are the things that control your character's movement. WASD is forward, left, backward, and right, respectively. SHIFT allows you to sneak, like if you're on the edge of a block while sneaking, you won't be able to walk off. L CTRL is the most used sprint key, allowing the player to sprint, or run faster as compared to walking. Space allows you to jump. Now, the mouse is crucial for the movement of your character. The movement of your mouse determines the direction your character faces. This is the case in most fps shooters and such.
  <br>Minecraft has many versions of the game, ranging from 1.0 to 1.16. Current-day servers typically support 1.8 and above, but for parkour, 1.8 is preferred. This is mainly due to the drastic changes between 1.8 and 1.9+, therefore many people decided to stick to 1.8. However, there are a few parkour servers supporting only 1.12,mainly because of the introduction of certain new blocks and mechanics, but for now, 1.8 is the best way to play parkour.
